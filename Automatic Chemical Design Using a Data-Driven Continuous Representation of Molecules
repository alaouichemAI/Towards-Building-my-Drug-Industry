## Objective

Synthetysing more drug like molecules.
## Context

We have discovered arround 10^8 drug like molecules, we estimate the existence of 10^23 to 10^60: There is a lot to discover.
Machine learning is becoming increacingly effective in this domain.
## Method

Using an incoder: codes the molecules to SMILES vector (better than InCHI in terms of resullts)
tasks of the encoder: Molecules reconstraction, molecules properties prediction.
Using a perceptron: NN system.
## What I have learned

Latent space: compressed representation of data.
QED: Quantitative Estimation of Drug-Likeness
KDE: Kernel Density Estimator
QM9: Small molecules dataset: - 134000 molecules
                              - 9 heavy atoms
Bayesian inference: Updating your beliefs when you see new evidence
GRU: handles long term dependencies better than LSTM
