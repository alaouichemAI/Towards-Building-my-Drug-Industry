## Week 1 – 2025-08-12
1. Studied the course of Python for Data Science, AI & Development.The reason is the importance of AI in the drug industry.  
2. Revised AI general concepts taking the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) course.

N.B: I will publish the certificates in my LinkedIn Portfolio: www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-belghiti-alaoui-568600326

## Week 2 – 2025-08-19
1. Studied the course of Understanding Research Methods.The reason is learning how to build my research proposal, because I might not stick to the PhD next year program if it's not aligned with my goals.
2. Worked on setting up N8N for automating my social media.

N.B.: I'm still working on the automations
## Week 3 – 2025-08-27
1. I have practiced english speaking, because I'm preparing for the IELTS.
2. Fixed the N8N memory problem + settup 2 automations.
3. Practiced some coding in Pandas and matplotlib.pyplot and numpy libraries.

N.B.: I'm late one dayin submitting.
## Week 4 – 2025-09-03
1. Took the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI). I had 2 goals: - Find new AI tolls I might use: failed because the devellopement in the AI domain is fast, so the tools I saw are outdated. 
- Get new ideas on how I can use AI to be more productive
2. Made several news automations in my LinkedIn account:
  - for chemistry
  - for AI
  - for robotics
  - for renewable energies (I don't care a lot but the scientific community does)
  - for business
  - for leadership
My account: www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-belghiti-alaoui-568600326
N.B: The news I was interested about the most were drug developement news, but their websites are so antiscraping, so I have to find different approaches.
## Week 5 – 2025-09-09
1. I begun to code without looking at the keybord.
2. Took the course with the title: Collaborate Effectively for Professional Success
I want to become a better collaborator
3. Made 2 news automations in my LinkedIn account:
   - Chemistry phenoms explainer
   - General phenoms from a chemical perspective
## Week 6 – 2025-09-16
I'm focused on one thing: Preparing for the PhDs interviews, that will increase my chance to get the PhD I want. I will also learn a lot of things.
## Week 7 – 2025-09-23
I have finished my preparation for the PhD interviews.
## Week 8 – 2025-09-30
1. I have finished training my first QSAR model for A2A receptor, I fine-tuned it to 63.7% accuracy with only 1738 molecules.
2. Made several news automations in my LinkedIn account, and optimised old ones:
   - soft skills (new)
   - molecules facts (new)
   - chemistry wisdoms (optimised)
   - career advices (new)
   - lab tips (optimised)
## Week 9 – 2025-10-07
1. I have finished training 2 other QSAR models, the receptors are CAII and CAIV,I have used the same code.
2. Produced a pre-print for the A2A receptor. The resulets: https://github.com/alaouichemAI/Articles
