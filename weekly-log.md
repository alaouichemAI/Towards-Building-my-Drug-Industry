## Week 4 – 2025-09-03
1. Took the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI). I had 2 goals: - Find new AI tolls I might use: failed because the devellopement in the AI domain is fast, so the tools I saw are outdated. 
- Get new ideas on how I can use AI to be more productive
2. Made several news automations in my LinkedIn account:
  for chemistry
  for AI
  for robotics
  for renewable energies (I don't care a lot but the scientific community does)
  for business
  for leadership
My account: www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-belghiti-alaoui-568600326
N.B: The news I was interested about the most were drug developement news, but their websites are so antiscraping, so I have to find different approaches.
