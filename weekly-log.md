## Week 1 – 2025-08-12
1. Studied the course of Python for Data Science, AI & Development.The reason is the importance of AI in the drug industry.  
2. Revised AI general concepts taking the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) course.

N.B: I will publish the certificates in my LinkedIn Portfolio: www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-belghiti-alaoui-568600326

## Week 2 – 2025-08-19
1. Studied the course of Understanding Research Methods.The reason is learning how to build my research proposals.
2. Worked on setting up N8N for automating my social media.

N.B.: I'm still working on the automations
## Week 3 – 2025-08-27
1. I have practiced english speaking, because I'm preparing for the IELTS.
2. Fixed the N8N memory problem + settup 2 automations.
3. Practiced some coding in Pandas and matplotlib.pyplot and numpy libraries.

N.B.: I'm late one dayin submitting.
## Week 4 – 2025-09-03
1. Took the course of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI). I had 2 goals: - Find new AI tolls I might use: failed because the devellopement in the AI domain is fast, so the tools I saw are outdated. 
- Get new ideas on how I can use AI to be more productive
2. Made several news automations in my LinkedIn account:
  - for chemistry
  - for AI
  - for robotics
  - for renewable energies (I don't care a lot but the scientific community does)
  - for business
  - for leadership
My account: www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-el-belghiti-alaoui-568600326
N.B: The news I was interested about the most were drug developement news, but their websites are so antiscraping, so I have to find different approaches.
## Week 5 – 2025-09-09
1. I begun to code without looking at the keybord.
2. Took the course with the title: Collaborate Effectively for Professional Success
I want to become a better collaborator
3. Made 2 news automations in my LinkedIn account:
   - Chemistry phenoms explainer
   - General phenoms from a chemical perspective
## Week 6 – 2025-09-16
I'm focused on one thing: Preparing for the PhDs interviews, that will increase my chance to get the PhD I want. I will also learn a lot of things.
## Week 7 – 2025-09-23
I have finished my preparation for the PhD interviews.
## Week 8 – 2025-09-30
1. I have finished training my first QSAR model for A2A receptor, I fine-tuned it to 63.7% accuracy with only 1738 molecules.
2. Made several news automations in my LinkedIn account, and optimised old ones:
   - soft skills (new)
   - molecules facts (new)
   - chemistry wisdoms (optimised)
   - career advices (new)
   - lab tips (optimised)
## Week 9 – 2025-10-07
1. I have finished training 2 other QSAR models, the receptors are CAII and CAIV,I have used the same code.
2. Produced a pre-print for the A2A receptor. The resulets: https://github.com/alaouichemAI/Articles
## Week 10 – 2025-10-14
1. I have took some PhD interviews.
2. I am working on importing kaggle GPU in my VScode notebook to automate training multiple AIs, some advancement.
## Week 11 – 2025-10-21
1. I have finished more than 70% of my website: www.chemisters.com, still has some bugs.
2. I am working on my automated QSAR model, I have improved the descriptors calculation and exclusion codes.
3. I have built several automations and added them to my LI account.
## Week 12 – 2025-10-28
I have stopped everything temporarly, the reason is that I'm focusing all of my attention on the IELTS exam in 15/11/2025
## Week 13 – 2025-11-04
I'm still preparing for the IELTS test...
## Week 14 – 2025-11-11
I'm still preparing for the IELTS test...

After this saturday, I will be finally free.
## Week 15 – 2025-11-18
I finally got my IELTS

My QSAR program now takes databases from multiple sources, not just ChemBL
## Week 16 – 2025-11-25
Now my code will work on multiple endpoints, it's no longer a QSAR QSTR study, but a full study for each receptor.

I am still adding more data sources...
## Week 17 – 2025-12-02
Now my code gathers correctly essays data from PubChem and BindingDB

Those are the endpoints I'm working on now:

✔ Potency:

IC50, EC50, AC50, MIC

✔ Affinity:

Ki, Kd, Ka, kon, koff, Bmax

✔ Efficacy:

Emax, intrinsic activity, τ (tau), bias factor

✔ Functional signaling:

GPCR: cAMP, IP1/IP3, Ca²⁺, β-arrestin, GTPγS


RTK: pERK, pAKT, pSTAT

Ion channel: I, G, Po, V½, desensitization
## Week 18 – 2025-12-09
I've decided the architecture of my classification and regression meta-models

I've added Lipinski rules study to my code

I've added a rules based system that decides if a molecule will penetrate a specific organ based on a rules based descriptors system

I've built a code that calculates more than 8000 descriptors for each molecule (I have a lot of endpoints so I have to add more descriptors to asssure the quality of each AI model)
## Week 19 – 2025-12-16
I've desined a specific cleaning pipeline for every family that selects the best cleaning hyperparameters (took too much time)
Changed how I handle ambiguous values to min max approach
## Week 20 – 2025-12-23
I'm implementing the logic of dealing with special values like << and intervals...
## Week 21 – 2025-12-30
I'm studying the different stacking approaches for my regression model.
## Week 22 – 2025-01-06
I've built my stacking code.
I've optimized my codes memory efficiency
## Week 23 – 2025-01-13
I've finally completed the meta QSR
## Week 24 – 2025-01-20
I've built more than 30 automations
## Week 25 – 2025-01-28
I've built more than 10 automations
The QSR program now automates creating its apps
## Week 26 – 2025-02-03
I've built more than 100 automation
The QSR program that automates creating its apps still has some bugs, I'm still fixing them
